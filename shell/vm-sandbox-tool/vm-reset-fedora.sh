#!/bin/sh
# NOTE!!!!
# this script should be run via sudo
#
# 1) Before starting, build a centos7 VM or download a cloud image for centos7
#    and then save the base qcow2 file.  See BASE below.
#
# 2) Using virt-manager define a number of VMs (e.g. 3 VMs if that's what you
#    need).  You MUST ensure that the libvirt disk name matches the hostname,
#    e.g. host-01 uses host-01.qcow2.  This should be the default behaviour.
#
# 3) You don't need to install the OS multiple times.  Either build once if you
#    are need to customize the OS, or just use the cloud image.
#
# 4) ensure your dynamic range for libvirt does not overlap with your IPs.  On
#    a workstation or laptop, you can run :  virsh net-edit default
#    and change the range for the IPs allocated to guests.  e.g. I use:
#
#     <range start='192.168.122.101' end='192.168.122.254'/>
#
#    Note: on fedora 23 it seems 192.168.124.x/24 was used, but this may vary
#          based on your installation.
#
#    This is to allow for static IPs on the guests.
#
# 5) Once you have your guests defined, also define them in the "guests"
#    associative array (REQUIRES BASH version 4!!!).
#
# 6) Edit the script being called in chroot (see "content_update" below)
#    and add your desired SSH pubkeys for your guests.
#
# This script will reset your guests to a vanilla state.
